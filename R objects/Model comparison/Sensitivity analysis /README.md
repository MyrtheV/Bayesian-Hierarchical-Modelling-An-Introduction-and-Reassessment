# Sensitivity analysis 

The data sets "bsf_scenario1.csv", "bsf_scenario2.csv" and "bsf_scenario3.csv" contain the Bayes factors of the null normal model against the other models (full, digit, and side normal model) in each scenario estimated by `.rstan`. For each data set, the first column "Fit 1" contains the Bayes factors. The second column "model" specifies to which model the null model is compared to. The Bayes factor of the null model against the null model is trivial and, therefore, not reported ("NA").  

The file "sensbfs_results.rds" contains the posterior model probabilities shown in Table 3 of the manuscript.
